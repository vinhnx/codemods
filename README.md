# # Organization Codemods

Official codemods for your organization to help users adopt new features and handle breaking changes with less manual work.

Community contributions are welcome. Use this repository to create, validate, and publish codemods from a shared monorepo.

## One-time setup

1. Create this codemod repository in your organization.
2. Sign in to [Codemod](https://app.codemod.com) with your GitHub account.
3. Install the Codemod GitHub app for this repository so publishes can be associated with your organization.
4. Configure a [trusted publisher](https://docs.codemod.com) in Codemod so GitHub Actions can publish with OIDC.
5. Reserve an organization scope in Codemod before publishing so your packages stay grouped in the Codemod Registry.

Use [Codemod MCP](https://docs.codemod.com/model-context-protocol) and `npx codemod init` to create new codemods from this monorepo.

## Repository layout

Each codemod lives under `codemods/<slug>/`.

```text
codemods/<slug>/
  workflow.yaml
  codemod.yaml
  scripts/
  tests/
```

Keep each codemod self-contained so maintainers can validate and publish packages independently.

## Creating codemods

- Scaffold new codemods with `npx codemod init`.
- Use Codemod MCP when creating or refining codemods, especially when symbol definitions or cross-file references matter.
- Validate package workflows with `npx codemod workflow validate codemods/<slug>/workflow.yaml`.
- Run package tests from the codemod directory before publishing.

## Running codemods

> [!CAUTION]
> Codemods modify code. Run them only on Git-tracked files, and commit or stash changes first.

### From the registry

```bash
npx codemod <codemod-name>
```

### From source

```bash
npx codemod workflow run -w codemods/<slug>/workflow.yaml
```

By default, codemods run in the current folder. Add `--target /path/to/repo` to run elsewhere.

## Publishing and contribution guidance

- Use the generated GitHub Actions workflow to publish after review and merge.
- Add a `CONTRIBUTING.md` in this repository to document review, testing, and release expectations for contributors.
- See the [Codemod docs](https://go.codemod.com/docs) for CLI and publishing details.
